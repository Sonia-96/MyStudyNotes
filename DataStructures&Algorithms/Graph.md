# Graph

## Graph Basics

1. Types:
   - undirected graph
   - directed graph
   - weighted graph
2. Terminologies
   - Graph:
     - vertice / node
     - edge
     - adjacent vertices / neighbors
   - path
   - cycle
   - connected
   - degree
     - In-degree
     - out-degree
3. Graph representation
   - adjacent list: suitable for sparse graph
   - adjacent matrix: suitable for dense graph
   - edge set
4. Graph Problems // TODO

## Graph Traversal

### Depth First Search (DFS)

```java
```

### Breadth First Search (BFS)

```java
```
