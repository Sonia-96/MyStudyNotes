## **Midterm Exam Review**

The midterm exam will be in-class / written with one hand-written sheet of notes allowed. Given the 1.5-hour time frame, it is unreasonable to test extensively on most of the programming we've done with pandas/sklearn/matplotlib/etc since having access to the online documentation is vital to being able to work with these tools. Thus, the exam will be focused on the main concepts for the course, not how we interact with our tools in Jupyter notebooks.

### **Topics**

#### **Homework Assignments / Lectures**

- You should review topics discussed in class and found on homework assignments.

#### **Basic Statistics**

- common descriptive stats and their meanings
- working with probability distributions
- common probability distributions (discrete and continuous)

#### **Hypothesis testing**

- What are we trying to show when we perform a hypothesis test?
- What is a P-value and what is its significance?
- What is the "null hypothesis?"

#### **Visualization**

- What are the basic types of plots we work with?
- What is a mark?
- What is a channel? Which channels are the most effective at conveying information to humans?

#### **Linear regression**

- How does linear regression measure the quality of a "line"?
- What are the important statistics that can help us understand the quality of our regression?
- What kinds of models can we fit with ordinary least squares?

#### **Getting data**

- What's the difference between web scraping/using an API?

#### **Classification**

- What is logistic regression? How is it related to/different from linear regression?
- What is KNN classification?
- What are the common spatial partitioning data structures used to implement KNN efficiently?
- What are the limitations of logistic regression?
- What are the available knobs to tune with KNN, and what effect to they have on the trained classifier?
- What is a decision tree? What are their pros/cons?
- What is bootstrapping?
- What is bagging?
- What are random forests?
- What is cross validation and why is it useful/important?
- What are SVMs and what knobs do we have?

#### **Clustering**

- What's the difference between clustering/classification?
- How does K-means clustering/Lloyd's algorithm work?
- What is hierarchical clustering?
- How does the "bottom up" (agglomerative approach) construct a hierarchical clustering?
- What is a dendrogram and how do you read one?
- What types of distance (dissimilarity) measures might we use for clustering?
- What is a linkage criterion? What are some examples of popular linkage criteria?

#### **Dimensionality Reduction/PCA**
